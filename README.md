# DeFi-AI Loan & Asset Management Platform

![Project Banner]()

> A decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized, risk-assessed loans and asset management on the BlockDAG blockchain. Built for HackOdisha 5.0 hackathon.

## 🌟 Overview

This project reimagines DeFi lending by integrating AI-driven risk scoring into the loan process. Users can deposit cryptocurrency as collateral and borrow stablecoins at optimized rates based on their AI-calculated creditworthiness. The platform combines multiple cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless, intelligent DeFi experience.

### 🎯 Problem Solved

Traditional DeFi lending relies on fixed collateral ratios, often resulting in suboptimal rates and access barriers. Our platform uses AI to assess borrower risk dynamically, enabling more inclusive and profitable lending.

### 🏆 Hackathon Goals

- Demonstrate innovative integration of Web3, AI, and analytics
- Showcase practical application of BlockDAG for DeFi
- Highlight ease of development using Verbwire API
- Utilize Akash's decentralized compute for AI workloads
- Provide data insights via Wolfram analytics

## 🚀 Features
